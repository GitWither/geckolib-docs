GeckoLib was developer mostly by me, Gecko. Several other people contributed assets, art, and code. Thank you to these people:

- Eliot for the help porting to fabric, work on the geckolib blockbench plugin, and easing implementation

- The Ult1mate Guy, NerevarDZN, Slumberous Carp, and Lewbae for the assets and designs
